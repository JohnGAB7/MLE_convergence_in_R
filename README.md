# MLE Convergence in R

Welcome to the MLE Convergence in R project! ðŸ“Š

## Overview

This repository explores Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) convergence in R, covering various statistical concepts and the implementation of MLE in different scenarios.

## Shiny Application

I've developed an interactive Shiny application that showcases the convergence results discussed in this project. You can explore the application by following this link:

[Access the Shiny Application](https://johngab7.github.io/MLE_convergence_in_R/)

Feel free to interact with the visualizations and analyze the convergence behaviors. Your feedback is greatly appreciated!
