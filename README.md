# MLE Convergence in R

Welcome to the MLE Convergence in R project! üìä

## Overview

This repository explores Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) convergence in R, covering various statistical concepts and the implementation of MLE in different scenarios.

## Shiny Applications

I've developed two interactive Shiny applications that showcase different aspects of the convergence results discussed in this project. Here's a brief description of each application:

### 1. MLE Convergence Application üìà

Explore the behavior of Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) convergence in various statistical scenarios. Visualize convergence trajectories, parameter estimates, and related statistics. Dive into different models and observe how MLE performs in different settings.

Access the [MLE Convergence Application](https://johngab7.github.io/MLE_convergence_in_R/) and analyze the convergence patterns for your specific use case.

### 2. Monte Carlo GMM Estimation Application üîç

This application focuses on the convergence of Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) estimation through Monte Carlo simulations. Investigate the performance of GMM under different conditions, including sample sizes and true parameter values. Visualize estimation results and gain insights into the efficiency of GMM in estimating model parameters.

Access the [Monte Carlo GMM Estimation Application](https://johngab7.shinyapps.io/monte_carlo_for_gmm_estimation/) and experiment with GMM convergence in a simulated environment.

Feel free to interact with the visualizations in both applications and analyze the convergence behaviors. Your feedback is greatly appreciated!
